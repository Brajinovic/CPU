# Super simple CPU learning project
## QUCS
At first I started doing this by using VHDL but I encountered some problems with joining all the modules together in the ALU and then I stopped doing it alltogether.

Now I am starting again but this time I am using QUCS electroinic circuit simulator and am building everything as a schematic. Right now I have build an 8 bit adder and the next thing I want to add is some memory for storing the result of the operation as well as memory to store the operands.
